# CryptoWhaleHunter
Under Construction/ Python 2.7
Tracking Ethereum Whales
This script parses the data found in etherscan(Live Blockchain Explorer) and traces transactions bigger than 20ETH. Then it logs the addresses and the exact amounts in a '.txt' file.
Create the txt in the same directory with the script. Run as 'python whaleLogger.py txtName.txt'
Note: This is the first draft and its poorly written. The final form of this project will be a lot different
